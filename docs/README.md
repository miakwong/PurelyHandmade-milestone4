# Overview:

The project is designed to help develop your skills for full stack development.  With this project, you will build an online application that will allow users to register, create and participate in different features of your site.  The project is a group project of 3 people.   Please note that the grading rubric for different aspects of the project.  

# Hardware and Software:

You will develop the project using Linux, MySQL, Apache and PHP on cosc360.ok.ubc.ca,in addition to CSS, HTML5 and JavaScript on the client-side.  The backend must be completed with PHP.  Your project will be stored in a GitHub repository and will deployed to the cosc360 server.  The project must be accessible on the UBC network and all source code must be available for review.  You are required to keep your code under version control with GIT.

Community skill-sharing platform
A  web app where users can create profiles, list their skills, and offer to teach others. Users can book sessions with others to learn new skills.

Virtual Library and Book Exchange Platform:
A platform where users can share, borrow, and exchange books with others in their local community.

Job Board and Career Portal
 A job listing platform where companies can post job openings and job seekers can apply and create profiles showcasing their skills.

Personal Blogging Platform

5. E-Commerce Store for Handmade Goods

A functional e-commerce platform where artisans can list and sell their handmade products.

Your site must be able to categorize items such as products. Users should be able to create an account. Users should be able to create content such as comments, reviews, posts, feedback etc.

User types

There must be 3 types of users: unregistered users, registered users and admin users.

Unregistered users can search/browse items on the site but can not create content.

Registered users can create content and must have an account.

Admin users can monitor the activities of users on the site.

Project Objectives: The objectives are divided into two categories. The first category is the minimal requirements for the project to get a passing grade (C). The other requirements are some of the additional options that can be added to create an improved project. These objectives are further divided based on the implementation of different functional components utilizing different technologies.

# Baseline Objectives:
Website user’s objectives:

Browse site without registering
Search for items/posts by keyword without registering
Register at the site by providing their name, e-mail and image
Allow user login by providing user id and password
Create and comment (specific for each project) when logged into the site
Users are required to be able to view/edit their profile
Website administrator’s objectives:

Search for user by name, email or post
Enable/disable users
Edit/remove posts items or complete posts (project dependent
 As this project is about demonstrating and applying different technologies, you will utilize different technologies in the construction of the site.   

# Minimum Functional Requirements (for a C grade):

Hand-styled layout with contextual menus (i.e. when user has logged on to site, menus reflect change). Layout frameworks are not permitted other than Bootstrap
2 or 3 column layout using appropriate design principles (i.e. highlighting nav links when hovered over, etc) responsive design
Form validation with JavaScript
Server-side scripting with PHP
Data storage in MySQL
Appropriate security for data
Site must maintain state (user state being logged on, etc)
Responsive design philosophy (minimum requirements for different non-mobile display sizes)
AJAX (or similar) utilization for asynchronous updates (meaning that if a discussion thread is updated, another user who is viewing the same thread will not have to refresh the page to see the update)
User images (thumbnail) and profile stored in database
Simple discussion (topics) grouping and display
Navigation breadcrumb strategy (i.e. user can determine where they are in threads)
Error handling (bad navigation)
Additional Requirements:

Search and analysis for topics/items
Hot threads/hot item tracking
Visual display of updates, etc (site usage charts, etc)
Activity by date
Tracking (including utilizing tracking API or your own with visualization tools)
Collapsible items/treads without page reloading
Alerts on page changes
Admin view reports on usage (with filtering)
Styling flourishes
Responsive layout for mobile
Tracking comment history from a user’s perspective
Accessibility
Your choice (this is your opportunity to add additional flourish to your site but will need to be documented in the final report)
Additional allowable technologies:

In addition to the core CSS3, PHP, HTML5 and JavaScript technologies, Bootstrap js and JQuery are permitted to be used. 

# Deliverables:
**1) Proposal - 7th of February**

**2) March 1st, 2025– 30% (Client-side experience - develop pages for your site)**

Develop the pages with client-side validation
Develop styles for pages
Examples of each page type in your proposed site
Create a Git Hub repository and add instructor and TAs.
You will submit the link to the GitHub repository

**3) March 23rd, 2025 - 30% (Site should have minimal core functionality - see above for minimum functionality requirement)**

Client-side security
Posted on cosc360.ok.ubc.ca
Server-side security
Discussion thread storage in database
Asynchronous updates
Database functionality complete
Core functional components operational (see baseline objectives)
Preliminary summary document, indicating implemented functionality
Submit a link to your repo and a PDF document that describes what you have done regarding the points listed above.

**4) April 10th, 2025  – 35% (The full site)**

Pages styled as per your design
Pages live on server
Client-side validation
Client-side security
Server-side implementation complete
Posted on cosc360.ok.ubc.ca
Server-side security
User account information stored in database
Items and associated details stored in database
Chats/threads maintained in database
Asynchronous updates for comments/posts/products etc (as one user types, it updates without reloading)
Database functionality complete
Core functional components operational (see baseline objectives)
A summary document, indicating implemented functionality and features (see below)
Final delivery of site with additional functionality
A 2-3 page walkthrough document that can be used to test the site by performing the walkthrough you describe.  It is to your advantage to include sufficient detail to highlight the best features of your website. This should also include things like required login ids and passwords, how to test your site as well as identifying any unique features.  This document will be used as a guide to test what you did. This document should be written as a user guide. 
A 2-3 page detailed description of your implementation from a system or developer's perspective including: What features did you implement? Include a description of the PHP and JavaScript files of your web site. How does your web site work at a high-level? Identify known limitations of the site? 
10% (of the 35% for this milestone)  is reserved for deployment, version control, client and server side testing (if you do not test or deploy the maximum you can get out of this section is 25/35). It is expected the team members will all contribute to the project (i.e. everyone is committing to the repo with work) AND that commits/efforts on the project will take place over the next several months.   Additionally, you (the team) will need to think about and investigate how to test different aspects of your site.
